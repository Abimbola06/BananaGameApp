# BananaGameApp
BananaGameApp is a small Java application developed for the Integrated Systems assignment.
It demonstrates four key Computer Science concepts:

Version Control – Using GitHub to manage project versions and commits.

Event-Driven Programming – The application reacts to user input and game events.

Interoperability – The app interacts with the external Banana API to fetch random quiz questions.

Virtual Identity – A simple login system identifies users before they can play the game.
